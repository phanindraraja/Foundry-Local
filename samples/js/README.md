## Running a Sample

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Foundry-Local.git
   cd Foundry-Local/samples/js
   ```

1. Navigate to a sample and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd native-chat-completions
   npm install
   ```

1. Run the sample:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

> [!TIP]
> Each sample's `package.json` includes `foundry-local-sdk` as a dependency and `foundry-local-sdk-winml` as an optional dependency. On **Windows**, the WinML variant installs automatically for broader hardware acceleration. On **macOS and Linux**, the standard SDK is used. Just run `npm install` — platform detection is handled for you.
